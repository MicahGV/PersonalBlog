Hello Internet stranger,

So, like millions of other websites, I use Google Analytics. It's a piece of software that will grab data about who visits this site.

## What Google analytics records

* How you got here, like a direct google search or a link in some forum
* How long you stay for and what pages you look at
* What kind of computer you are using
* And a quite bit more. You can read about what all it records **[here](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/features/)**

## What do I do with your data?

I use Google Analytics to gauge what parts of my site people are interested in, so I can probably make better decisions on what I should add next.

And I will occasionally aggregate statistics regarding the number of visitors and the average length of each visit. No personal identifiable information (PII) is used in this type of reporting.

All of this falls within the confines of the [Google Analytics Terms of Services](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/)
