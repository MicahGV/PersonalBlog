Hello Internet stranger,

I'm going to give a quick no nonsense run down on how this site was made and the links I used. It's mostly links.

First, I used the Netlify CMS [Hugo Site Starter](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/). Then I didn't like how much it of the config and set up it did and I ended up deleting it and ran down through all the tutorials/documentation below


## Links
The links are in order of what I looked at first and did

_Quick Side note: In the first link Add the kiera theme as a git submodule. You'll need to do that, so you can actually make a git repo with it in it. Like so,_

```gitconfig
cd themes
git add submodule https://github.com/avianto/hugo-kiera kiera
```

After you've ran through all of those you should have a site that pretty much looks exactly like this with an admin too boot. If you want to clone this and just use it as boiler plate or you want to see it for reference here's a link to the [repo](https://github.com/MicahGV/PersonalBlog) that this thing is coming out of.
Also, if you're lazy like me, here's a quick url for you to clone from
